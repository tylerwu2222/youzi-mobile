## Youzi: Social Mandarin Learning with Daily Prompts
This is a 2024 capstone project created for the Berkeley Master in Information Management and Systems program.

This app aims to make the process of (re)learning Mandarin more engaging for American-born Chinese (ABC's) and other Mandarin heritage speakers.
It does not intend to help a new speaker pick up the language, but rather provide an environment for already somewhat fluent, second-language speakers to find daily practice -- learning novel and contemporary content.
