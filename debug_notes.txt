current Async Storage issues:


- prompt recordings are persisting across sessions, because json...
- but NSFW and is_Trad are not... potentially have to do with either:
1) weird interaction of useState and AS item (this one makes more sense)
2) boolean value being stored weirdly

existingRecordings works (in AS and state)
--> model others like this

status:
-- toggles are now persisting...
-- setting initial value for onboarded, but this is problematic with initial null value:
    initialRouteName={onboarded ? 'onboarding-interests-page' : 'home-page'}


ChineseText component:
- I can nest text components w/in e/o, so I can nest dynamic S/T component w/in chinglish components

added react-native-voice to handle audio to transcription; will replace Expo AV for recording audio

- first test with en-US --> see if I can get transcript
- then test with mandarin

- audio async storage issue: deleting: first item will stick around? so all items pushed back by 1
- also need to stop recording on screen exit/app close
- don't need components > prompt review screen anymore

- should move OpenAI node function to firebase, then use Firebase JS SDK to connect: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/
