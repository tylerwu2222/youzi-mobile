current Async Storage issues:


- prompt recordings are persisting across sessions, because json...
- but NSFW and is_Trad are not... potentially have to do with either:
1) weird interaction of useState and AS item (this one makes more sense)
2) boolean value being stored weirdly

existingRecordings works (in AS and state)
--> model others like this

status:
-- toggles are now persisting...
-- setting initial value for onboarded, but this is problematic with initial null value:
    initialRouteName={onboarded ? 'onboarding-interests-page' : 'home-page'}


ChineseText component:
- I can nest text components w/in e/o, so I can nest dynamic S/T component w/in chinglish components

                Build file 'C:\Users\tyler\youzi-mobile\node_modules\expo-stt\android\build.gradle' line: 40

            * What went wrong:
            A problem occurred evaluating project ':expo-stt'.
            > Could not set unknown property 'classifier' for task ':expo-stt:androidSourcesJar' of type org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.        

            * Try:
            > Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

            Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

- tried downgrading to Gradle 7.6 ("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75660848/could-not-set-unknown-property-classifier-for-task-idl-parsersourcejar-of")
- idk... try again w Add Firebase SDK, nah
