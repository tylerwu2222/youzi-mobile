current Async Storage issues:


- prompt recordings are persisting across sessions, because json...
- but NSFW and is_Trad are not... potentially have to do with either:
1) weird interaction of useState and AS item (this one makes more sense)
2) boolean value being stored weirdly

existingRecordings works (in AS and state)
--> model others like this

status:
-- toggles are now persisting...
-- setting initial value for onboarded, but this is problematic with initial null value:
    initialRouteName={onboarded ? 'onboarding-interests-page' : 'home-page'}


ChineseText component:
- I can nest text components w/in e/o, so I can nest dynamic S/T component w/in chinglish components

added react-native-voice to handle audio to transcription; will replace Expo AV for recording audio

- first test with en-US --> see if I can get transcript
- then test with mandarin
